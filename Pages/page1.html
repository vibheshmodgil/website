                    <h2>Driving data collection </h2>
                    <p>
                        This report is based on the 2-wheeler driving pattern that the team members here at EML, Guwahati, measured in September and October. Collectively, the team drove over 1500 kms in different geographic locations of the
                        country, including Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, out of which over 1500 kms were
                        driven in urban centers and over 1000 kms in rural area. Based on these
                        driving data, varieties of real-world drive cycles were extracted. The driving
                        data covers Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, New Delhi,
                        Telangana, West Bengal, Bihar and Haryana.
                        Eventually, using these drive cycles, we estimated the motor rating (rated
                        and peak power and torque values, base and maximum speeds), converter rating, and appropriate energy and voltage rating of the battery pack. The report
                        also gives an insight into types of motors that can be used (hub versus frame),
                        motor topologies (induction, permanent magnet, synchronous reluctance, permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motors, etc.), and suitable
                        converter topologies. The report also has detailed pros and con analyses of
                        different motor and converter topologies.

                    <p>
                        This report provides a comprehensive procedure for estimating battery size, design and optimization of motor
                        specifications, fuel consumption and emission analysis from the raw drive cycle data.
                        Raw drive cycle data is collected from different parts of India and comprises of both urban and rural drive data,
                        this report is anticipated to represent the Indian driving scenario

                    <h2>Accessibility of Electric Vehicles in Indian Market</h2>
                    <p>
                        The "Acceptability of Electric Vehicles in Indian Market" reports the public’s view and expectations towards
electric mobility in the current scenario when there is a rapid shift towards greener mobility.
This survey aims to understand the actual demands of the consumer so that we can bridge the gap between
consumer expectations and the 2 Introduction products developed by OEMs.
